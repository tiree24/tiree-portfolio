        <p>
          I am a highly driven, motivated developer. I’ve had an interest in technology since I was younger. I love
          seeing how technology has changed over time and what new things people have created. Learning new coding
          languages in my spare time is exciting, and I like putting my skills to the test doing coding challenges,
          figuring out problems, and creating different applications that I can showcase. I’m ready to use all the
          knowledge I have learned to start off my career. Looking forward to meeting new people, learning from them,
          and teaching others what I have learned too.I am introverted and not extroverted well I will talk to a lot of
          people who start talking to me. My work ethic is pretty good I try to get everything done on time and in my
          management style I have a set time to do things like getting my work done then I can have free time to do
          whatever I like. What makes me tick is trying to have a bright future. Other people describe me as a chill,
          kind, helpful, pretty funny person.
